/**
 * Read-only interface for shapes that implement the sphere-torus-patches (STP) method to make
 * shapes strictly convex.
 * <p>
 * This data structure was implemented initially to improve continuity when performing collision
 * detection continuously over time. The overall data structure is pretty experimental still and
 * lack testing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The approach is from <a href=
 * "http://sylvain.miossec.free.fr/work/publis/IEEE_TRO_Escande_Miossec_Kheddar.pdf">Strictly convex
 * hulls for computing continuous gradient proximity distances</a>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The general idea is to smooth out vertices, edges, and faces. For instance, for a box, a small
 * sphere is used for its vertices, a (very) large sphere is used for each face and meets the small
 * spheres such that the connection is continuous, the edges use properly sized torus such that the
 * small and large spheres are connecting in a continuous manner. The geometry used behind the scene
 * can be somewhat confusing but visualization of such shape is pretty self-explanatory, see the
 * examples in the <i>simulation-construction-set-visualizers</i> repository.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instead of defining the radius for the small and large spheres, the user configure the smoothness
 * of an STP shape by defining a minimum margin and a maximum margin. The method used grows the
 * original shape, the more the shape is grown the smoother it is, until it pretty much look like a
 * sphere. The minimum margin represents the minimum distance from the original shape to the STP
 * version of the shape. When it is zero, vertices are not expanded into small spheres for instance.
 * The maximum margin in turn is the maximum distance from the original shape to the STP version of
 * the shape. This is main parameter for controlling the smoothness of the shape, for a high value
 * we obtain high smoothness but also the STP shape represents the original shape less accurately.
 * </p>
