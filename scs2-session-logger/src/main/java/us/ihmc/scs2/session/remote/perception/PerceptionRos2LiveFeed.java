/**
 * The one class callers construct to get live perception data. Owns a single {@link ROS2Node} for the live viewer,
 * shared by every perception source built on top of it via {@link #subscribe}. Each source's state and behavior
 * lives directly on this class as prefixed fields/methods (e.g. the height-map members below), rather than a
 * separate class per source - adding a new source means adding its prefixed members here, not a new class to
 * construct and thread through every call site that wants perception data. Mirrors {@code PerceptionMCAPLogger}'s
 * multi-channel design (one node, N independent subscriptions) on the write side.
 * <p>
 * Constructed once a session is fully connected/started, closed when that session ends.
 * <p>
 * == Height map ==
 * {@link #startHeightMap(Consumer)} drives a consumer (in practice {@code YoHeightGridFX3D::setData}) so it stays
 * in sync with the session's buffer position - including scrubbing backward through recently-received history
 * while a live session is paused, not just "whatever arrived most recently".
 * <p>
 * This relies on the controller (see {@code HeightScanTerm} in ihmc-closed-source-control) publishing its own
 * {@code lastHeightScanTimestamp} YoLong alongside {@code HeightScanMessage} - a real registered variable, so it
 * rides the session's existing {@code YoSharedBuffer} tick-for-tick for free (sample-and-hold across ticks with no
 * new height-scan message, exact restore on scrub) with no client-side buffering of our own to get wrong. If that
 * variable isn't present (older controller build, or a robot config without {@code HeightScanTerm}), the live
 * height map is simply unavailable - see {@link #isHeightMapAvailable()} - mirroring how
 * {@code HeightMapMcapScrubber}/{@code PerceptionMcapScrubber} report absence on the log-file side. Callers should
 * check {@link #isHeightMapAvailable()} before deciding whether to build a graphic at all, then call
 * {@link #startHeightMap(Consumer)}.
 * <p>
 * The one thing kept locally is a bounded history of decoded {@link HeightMapData}, keyed by the exact
 * {@code controllerTimestamp} of each received message - looked up by the (possibly time-traveled) value of
 * {@code lastHeightScanTimestamp} on every buffer-position change. This is an exact lookup, not a nearest-match
 * search, since that YoLong always holds the precise timestamp that was authoritative at that tick. The history's
 * capacity tracks the session's own buffer size (see {@code historyCapacity} in {@link #startHeightMap}) rather than
 * a fixed number of messages - anything the {@code YoSharedBuffer} can still scrub {@code lastHeightScanTimestamp}
 * back to needs a matching cached entry here too, or the mesh would silently stop following the scrub once it ran
 * past a smaller cap.
 * <p>
 * RL control mode loads every available policy up front (see {@code RLController}), so the live registry tree
 * typically has several sibling {@code HeightScanTerm} registries - one per model - all sharing the same leaf name.
 * Only the currently-active policy's {@code lastHeightScanTimestamp} actually advances; the rest sit frozen at
 * whatever value they had when last active (or their initial 0). Rather than hardcoding which model is "the" active
 * one - which would break the moment the operator switches policies mid-session - every matching candidate is
 * tracked and, each tick, whichever holds the largest value is used. Since {@code controllerTimestamp} comes from a
 * single shared monotonic clock, the max across candidates is always the one that's currently (or most recently)
 * advancing, with no need to know the active model's name.
